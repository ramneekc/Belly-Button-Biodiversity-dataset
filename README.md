# Belly-Button-Biodiversity-dataset  
In this assignment, i built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using D3 and Plotly, three different visualizations are made that are changed at the same time when user selects a new sample from the dropdown menu.
